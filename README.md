How accurate are Jim Cramer's stock picks?

1. Where do I get Jim Cramer's data?
    - Twitter
    - CNBC/website
2. Where do I stock price data?
    - Yahoo Finance
3. What timeframe(s) do I want to look at?


7/21: Took a look at a few sites that claim to have Cramer's stock picks, but none of the sites are active anymore. Also found a few research projects asking the same question.
